# Linux Python Docker Container

[![Docker](https://github.com/sfuhrm/linux-python-docker/actions/workflows/docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sfuhrm/linux-python-docker/actions/workflows/docker.yml)

Github actions build infrastructure to matrix-build
several versions of Linux Distributions
with their default Python interpreter.

## Motivation for the repository

The repository exists to test-drive Ansible Molecule without
the need of letting Molecule build its own python-enabled Docker
images which is a time consuming process.

## How to use

Just log in to docker and type

```bash
docker pull docker.io/stephanfuhrmannionos/linux-python-docker:$TAG
```
